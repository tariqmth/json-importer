Would be really nice to have the following:

* Interface to select author or create new author/email
* Configuration to Import 
- check boxes to import comments, likes,media,etc
- custom field selection option
 
* Import directly from FB feed
* Show progress bar while importing
* Check already imported (need to somehow identify feed, we have ID, could be done)
* Exclude/Include Comments author
* Save import configuration as a file 
* Allow to Schedule import with configuration file
